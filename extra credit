5-Create  a bar code. Yes, the same bar code we see on packages.  While it looks like magic, it's not. A zip code
# has all numeric values. They are coded with line characters (|).  A 1 would be |, two would be ||, etc. If the
# first two digits if a zip are 23, the first two positions of a bar code would look like this: || ||| Your job is to
# take a zip code and convert it to a bar code. for this question it is not necessary to ask for user input. for
# zero, just put a blank space
'''
I wrote a code for any number instead of just a zipcode

print("\n********EXTRA CREDIT********\n")

x = input('Enter any digit number:(only numericals)\n')
barcode = []

for i in range(len(x)):
    k = int(x[i])
    if k > 0:
        barcode.append('|' * k)
    else:
        barcode.append(' ')

print(barcode)
barcodes=''.join(barcode)
print(barcodes)
